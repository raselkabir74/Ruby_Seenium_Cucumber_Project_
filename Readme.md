Welcome to the Ruby Cucumber and Selenium project! In this project, we will be using the Ruby programming language, Cucumber framework, and Selenium WebDriver to automate tests for a web application.

Here are some instructions to help you get started:

# Prerequisites
 - Ruby 2.5 or higher installed
 - Bundler gem installed (gem install bundler)
 - Chrome or Firefox web browser installed

# Setup
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.
3. Run bundle install to install the required gems.

# Running the tests
1. Make sure that the web application you want to test is running locally or on a server.
2. Update the env.rb file with the URL of the web application.
3. In your terminal/command prompt, run the following command to execute all tests:

**_Cucumber_**
If you want to execute tests for a specific feature file, use the following command:
php

**_cucumber features/<feature_file_name>.feature_**

4. The test results will be displayed in the terminal/command prompt.

# Writing new tests
1. Create a new feature file in the features directory with the extension .feature.
2. Write your test scenarios using the Gherkin syntax.
3. Create a new step definition file in the step_definitions directory.
4. Implement the step definitions for your test scenarios using Ruby and Selenium WebDriver.

# Tips
 - Keep your feature files and step definitions organized by grouping them into subdirectories based on the functionality they test.
 - Use the Before and After hooks in the env.rb file to set up and tear down any necessary test data or resources.
 - Use the Page Object Model design pattern to keep your code maintainable and readable.
